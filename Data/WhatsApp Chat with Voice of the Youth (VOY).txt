8/15/22, 10:30 PM - Ochanda: Fellow kenyans , going by what has transpired today at Bomas of Kenya ,I wish to put it very clear that it was an exercise in futility ,We have gone through the same experience before and all know how it went, Kenyans When i.e.b.c announced Uhuru Kenyatta as president elect-immediately after the pronouncement ,the security arrangements were of high class, Presidential motorcades were waiting outside,Then Uhuru was driven to State house under a very tight security,guys believe me RUTO was playing political games which will end in shame, Fellow kenyans ,We have a day with destiny when the true president elect will receive his certificate from the four Commissioners and thereafter the security arrangements and presidential motorcades that ruto did not succeed to have today will be available for President Elect Raila Odinga.When on Earth do you have a president elect having received a certificate end up remaining at the same spot for hours? Now who will provide ruto with the presidential benefits after misbehaving at Bomas today,He must know that Kenya is not Uganda and real game will start tomorrow.....we as kenyans will and i repeat we will not watch People steal everything including Elections......BABA MUST BE PRESIDENT.....WATCH OUT FROM TOMORROW--+NO TO CHEBURUTO MIND GAME

8/15/22, 11:09 PM - Millionaires Mind: Maybe you were not very keen on the Squad that escorted the president-elect to the podium of the BOMAS of Kenya. Once the Chair of the Commission validates the results of the election, before declaring, the president must be informed of the winner, together with the NIS, the US and UK embassies and the General chief of staff. It's then, that arrangements are made to protect the president-elect because from then, he's nolonger existing as an individual but as a state property
8/15/22, 11:12 PM - Millionaires Mind: The Recce Squad, which is the Most elite squad drawn from the GSU is tasked with offering security to the president -elect, as in the protocol. Please check again
8/15/22, 11:13 PM - Ochanda: 🤝🤝
8/15/22, 11:13 PM - Millionaires Mind: The presence of heavy security at the residence of the President and deputy president-elect before the declaration is also an indicator

9/3/22, 10:36 AM - +254 710 835708: *15 HARD QUESTIONS TO CHEBUKATI:*

1. Why did the Chairman allocate “domestic”chores to the other Commissioners? 

2. What is the check for the all powerful IEBC Chairman? 

3. Why did he not wait for the next day to announce? 

4. What is the constitutional role of the other Commissioners under Article 140?

5. Compare that with the role of the Secretariat and the Chair. 

6. Why did live result transmission stop? 

7. If NSAC visited the Chair, are we to assume that they already knew the results? 

8. Why did the %age for the voter turn out decrease? 

9. What if there were no agents? Article 81 places the burden of a free, fair, accountable etc election on IEBC. Where there are no agents, what is the process?

10.  Comment on the walking away of the 4 Commissioners almost at the same time as the Chair was about to announce the results. 

11. How was 👆🏽timed? Does their walking out mean anything under Article 140? If yes, why. If no, why?

12. What were the Venezuelans maintaining in the server prior to elections? 

13. We are not witnesses neither were we at Bomas. Do you expect us to apportion blame? 

14. What is the Court to do where Commissioners take the position of a party, as they have done? 

15. When did the IEBC become dysfunctional?
